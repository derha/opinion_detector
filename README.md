# Opinion Detector
A sentiment analysis tool for movie reviews.

I used the SAR14 dataset, which can be found here: https://github.com/daiquocnguyen/SAR14

This repository contains two versions:
1. script(opinion_detector.py)
2. jupyter notebook(opinion_detector.ipynb)

Before running the script/notebook, don't forget to download the dataset and save it in the project directory.
